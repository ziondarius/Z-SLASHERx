# Backlog Issues
- Multiplayer mode
- Add restart button to pause menu
- Settings are not deterministically loaded from memory
- UI rendering is not handeled at one spot
- Mypy is not checking untyped functions (possible code quality leak)
- Editor needs extensive documentation for general usage
- Readme needs general update
- Simplify install process
- Verify that state implementation migration from old menu/game is complete + Migrate fully from old game/menu (lose all legacy functions) 
- Can't select via mouse in pause menu
- Add collectable lives (rare)
- Add tutorial in menu
- Implement diffrent enemy behavior based on locations on the map (How is Super Mario solving this? -> Different enemy types, have different behavior. Easy!) 
- Add selected accessories to HUD in menu
- Performance HUD full test coverage
- Audio Ducking full implementation
- Add Game Over screen
- Verify deterministic respawn
- Investigate how the state manager system works (down on process management level) + Check for possible efficiency upgrade
